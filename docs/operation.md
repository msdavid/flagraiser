Upon turn on, the device defaults to Operational mode in either up or down directions. 
In this (operational) mode the button START will comence the flag raising/lowering  
at a speed based on previous settings of Pole and Song length. Note  
that the HOME postion (position zero) becomes the point at which the 
device was when turned on (either at the top of the mast or at the lowest end).

* Using a clip press the middle button (SET) through the pinhole.  
* The LED will start blinking green. Now the device is in Pole-Lenght setting mode.   
* Using the START button, bring the flag to the top of the pole. 
* Once you are satified with the end (top) position press the middle button 
through the pinhole one more time to save the length of the pole. 
* The flag will return down to zero automatically and the LED will now 
flash Green indicating that the device is now  ready to record the Song-Lengh. 
* Start the song on a music player and press the RESET button once when 
the song has started. The LED will flash red rapidly indicating that the time is being recorded. 
* Wait for the song to end and press the RESET button one more time. The LED will blink slowly red.
